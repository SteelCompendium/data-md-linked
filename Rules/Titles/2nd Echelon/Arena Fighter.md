#### Arena Fighter

*You've never seen the showstopper? The move so brutal it was banned in the arena? Come closer and I'll show it to you.*

**Prerequisite:** You are victorious in battle in an arena or some other public contest of combat.

**Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

- *Dirty Fighting:* While you are standing, your melee strikes gain a +3 damage bonus against [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) creatures. Additionally, being [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) doesn't impose a bane on your strikes.
- *Foes as Weapons:* Whenever you have a creature of your size or smaller [grabbed](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Grabbed%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), you can use them as a weapon when you make a melee weapon free strike. Both the target and the [grabbed](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Grabbed%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) enemy take the strike's damage.
- *Instant Celebrity:* You earn 1 Renown.
- *Showstopper:* You have the following ability, which can be paid for using the Heroic Resource of your class.
