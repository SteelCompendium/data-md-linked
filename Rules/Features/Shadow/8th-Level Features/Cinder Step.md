##### Cinder Step

Whenever you willingly move, you can [teleport](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Teleport%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D). When you [teleport](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Teleport%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) this way, it counts as using a [shadow](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Classes/Shadow%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) ability for the purpose of using your Burning Ash and Trail of Cinders features.
