#### 5th-Level Specialization Feature

Your elemental specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the 5th-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.

###### 5th-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table

| Specialization | Feature                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Earth          | The Mountain Does Not Move   |
| Fire           | Smoldering Step              |
| Green          | Hide of Tenfold Shields      |
| Void           | Pierce the Veil of Substance |

##### Hide of Tenfold Shields

Your animal forms become hardier. You gain temporary Stamina equal to your level when you enter an [animal form](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Complications/Animal%20FormREL_PATH_SUFFIX) in combat, which is added to any temporary Stamina provided by the [animal form](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Complications/Animal%20FormREL_PATH_SUFFIX).

Additionally, an adjacent ally can use a maneuver to pet you. If they do so, you can lose temporary Stamina down to a minimum of 0. The ally gains temporary Stamina equal to the amount you lost.

##### The Mountain Does Not Move

You stand firm and magnetize your allies to stay grounded. Your [stability](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/StabilityREL_PATH_SUFFIX) increases by your level.

Additionally, whenever an ally within distance of your [Hurl Element](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Abilities/Elementalist/1st-Level%20Features/Hurl%20ElementREL_PATH_SUFFIX) ability is force moved, you can use a free triggered action to decrease your [stability](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/StabilityREL_PATH_SUFFIX) down to a minimum of 0, then increase the ally's [stability](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/StabilityREL_PATH_SUFFIX) by an amount equal to the [stability](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/StabilityREL_PATH_SUFFIX) you lost. This change lasts until the end of the round.

##### Pierce the Veil of Substance

Solidity is merely a suggestion to you. Mundane barriers that are 1 square thick or less do not block your senses or line of effect. You can only sense or have line of effect past one such barrier at a time.

Additionally, whenever you use a void ability, you or one ally within distance of the ability can [teleport](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/TeleportREL_PATH_SUFFIX) a number of squares equal to your Reason score.

##### Smoldering Step

You can use 1 square of movement to [walk](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/WalkREL_PATH_SUFFIX) into an area of fire your size or larger and [teleport](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/TeleportREL_PATH_SUFFIX) to any other area of fire your size or larger within 10 squares of the first area.

Additionally, whenever you use a fire ability or are targeted by an ability that deals fire damage, each enemy adjacent to you takes fire damage equal to your Reason score.
