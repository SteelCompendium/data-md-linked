###### Fix It in Post

Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to change one condition affecting a creature within distance of your Dramatic Monologue ability. Choose one of the following conditions on the target: [bleeding](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/BleedingREL_PATH_SUFFIX), [frightened](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/FrightenedREL_PATH_SUFFIX), [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX), [slowed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/SlowedREL_PATH_SUFFIX), or [taunted](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/TauntedREL_PATH_SUFFIX). You change that condition to another of those conditions, maintaining the duration and origin of the original condition. A target who is no longer [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX) can stand up.
