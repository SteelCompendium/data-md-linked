###### Fix It in Post

Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to change one condition affecting a creature within distance of your Dramatic Monologue ability. Choose one of the following conditions on the target: [bleeding](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Bleeding%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), [frightened](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Frightened%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), [slowed](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Slowed%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), or [taunted](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Taunted%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D). You change that condition to another of those conditions, maintaining the duration and origin of the original condition. A target who is no longer [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) can stand up.
