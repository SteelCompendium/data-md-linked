#### Suspensor Field

You can [fly](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Fly%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D). While flying, your stability is reduced to 0 and can't be increased. If you can already [fly](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Fly%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), you have a +2 bonus to speed while flying instead.

If you are strained while flying and are force moved, the forced movement distance gains a +2 bonus.
