##### Bounder

Your [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) distance and height double (see Movement Types in Chapter 10: Combat). Additionally, when you fall, you reduce the effective height of your fall by a number of squares equal to your [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) distance for the purpose of determining damage and whether you land [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) (see Falling in Chapter 10). You are not [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) after falling and landing on another creature.
