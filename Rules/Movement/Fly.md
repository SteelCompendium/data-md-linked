##### Fly

A creature who has "fly" in their speed entry, or who gains the temporary ability to [fly](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/FlyREL_PATH_SUFFIX), can move through the air vertically or horizontally at full speed and remain in midair. If a flying creature is knocked [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX) or has their speed reduced to 0, they fall (see [Falling](#page-283-3) below).
