##### Jump

Whenever an effect allows you to move (including using the Advance move action), you can automatically long [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX) a number of squares up to your Might or Agility score (your choice; minimum 1 square) as part of that movement. The height of your [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX) is automatically 1 square as part of that movement.

If you want to [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX) even longer or higher than your baseline [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX) allows, make a Might or Agility test:

**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**

- **≤11:** You don't [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX) any farther than your baseline [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX) allows.
- **12-16:** You [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX) 1 square longer and higher than your baseline [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX) allows.
- **17+:** You [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX) 2 squares longer and higher than your baseline [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX) allows.

You can't [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX) farther or higher than the distance of the effect that allows you to move. You can't [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX) out of difficult terrain or damaging terrain (see below).
