##### Jump

Whenever an effect allows you to move (including using the Advance move action), you can automatically long [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) a number of squares up to your Might or Agility score (your choice; minimum 1 square) as part of that movement. The height of your [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) is automatically 1 square as part of that movement.

If you want to [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) even longer or higher than your baseline [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) allows, make a Might or Agility test:

**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**

- **≤11:** You don't [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) any farther than your baseline [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) allows.
- **12-16:** You [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) 1 square longer and higher than your baseline [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) allows.
- **17+:** You [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) 2 squares longer and higher than your baseline [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) allows.

You can't [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) farther or higher than the distance of the effect that allows you to move. You can't [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) out of difficult terrain or damaging terrain (see below).
