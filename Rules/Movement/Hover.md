##### Hover

A creature who has "hover" in their speed entry (most commonly alongside "[fly](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Fly%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D)" or "[teleport](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Teleport%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D)"), or who gains the temporary ability to [hover](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Hover%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), can remain motionless in midair. They don't fall even if they are knocked [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) or their speed is reduced to 0.
