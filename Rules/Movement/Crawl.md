##### Crawl

If you are [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX) (see [Conditions](#page-91-2) in [Chapter 5: Classes](#page-83-2)), you can remain [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX) and [crawl](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/CrawlREL_PATH_SUFFIX) on the ground. Doing so costs you 1 additional square of movement for every square you [crawl](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/CrawlREL_PATH_SUFFIX). If you intentionally want to [crawl](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/CrawlREL_PATH_SUFFIX), you can fall [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX) as a free maneuver. While voluntarily [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX), you can choose to stand as a free maneuver.
