##### Crawl

If you are [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) (see [Conditions](#page-91-2) in [Chapter 5: Classes](#page-83-2)), you can remain [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) and [crawl](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Crawl%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) on the ground. Doing so costs you 1 additional square of movement for every square you [crawl](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Crawl%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D). If you intentionally want to [crawl](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Crawl%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), you can fall [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) as a free maneuver. While voluntarily [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), you can choose to stand as a free maneuver.
