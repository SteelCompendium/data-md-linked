##### Climb or Swim

A creature who has "[climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX)" in their speed entry, or who gains the temporary ability to automatically [climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX), can [climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) across vertical and horizontal surfaces at full speed. Likewise, a creature who has "[swim](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX)" in their speed entry, or who gains the temporary ability to automatically [swim](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX), can [swim](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) in liquid at full speed.

Creatures without those types of movement can still [climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) or [swim](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) when a rule allows them to move, but each square of climbing or swimming costs 2 squares of movement. If a surface is difficult to [climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) (for instance, a sheer cliff or ice-covered wall) or a liquid is hard to [swim](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) through (a raging river or whirlpool), the Director can call for a Might test. On a failure, a creature can't [climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) or [swim](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) but wastes no movement in the attempt. The Director can also impose other consequences to failure, such as being caught in the spinning current of a whirlpool.

###### Climbing Other Creatures

You can attempt to [climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) a creature whose size is greater than yours. If the creature is willing, you can [climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) them without any trouble. If the creature is unwilling, you make the following test:

**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**

- **≤11:** You fail to [climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) the creature, and they can make a free strike against you.
- **12-16:** You fail to [climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) the creature.
- **17+:** You [climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) the creature.

While you [climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX) or ride a creature, you gain an edge on melee abilities used against them. The creature can use a maneuver to attempt to knock you off, forcing you to make the following test:

**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**

- **≤11:** You fall off the creature into an unoccupied adjacent space of your choice, taking falling damage and landing [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX) as usual (see [Falling](#page-283-3) below).
- **12-16:** You slide down the creature into an unoccupied adjacent space of your choice and don't land [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX).
- **17+:** You continue to hold on to the creature.

If you are knocked [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX) while climbing or riding a creature, you fall and land [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX) in an adjacent space of your choice, taking damage as usual from the fall.
