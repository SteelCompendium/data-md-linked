#### Charge

When a creature takes the Charge main action, they move up to their speed in a straight line, then make a melee free strike (see [Free Strikes](#page-289-1) below) against a target when they end their move. If the creature has an ability with the Charge keyword, they can use that ability against the target instead of a free strike.

A creature can't move through difficult terrain or shift when they charge. They can [fly](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Fly%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) or [burrow](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Burrow%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) as part of the Charge main action if they have that movement available to them, but they can't \[climb\]({REL_PATH_PREFIX}Rules/Movement/Climb or Swim{REL_PATH_SUFFIX}) or \[swim\]({REL_PATH_PREFIX}Rules/Movement/Climb or Swim{REL_PATH_SUFFIX}) while charging unless they can automatically use that movement at full speed.
