> - **12-16:** You can escape the grab, but if you do, a creature who has you [grabbed](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Grabbed%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) can make a melee free strike against you before you are no longer [grabbed](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Grabbed%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D).
> - **17+:** You are no longer [grabbed](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Grabbed%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D).
>
> **Effect:** You take a bane on this maneuver if your size is smaller than the size of the creature, object, or effect that has you [grabbed](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Grabbed%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D).

See [Conditions](#page-91-2) in [Chapter 5: Classes](#page-83-2) for information on the [grabbed](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Grabbed%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) condition.
