##### Restrained

A creature who is [restrained](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Restrained%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) has speed 0, can't use the Stand Up maneuver, and can't be force moved. A [restrained](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Restrained%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) creature takes a bane on ability rolls and on Might and Agility tests, and abilities used against them gain an edge.

If a creature teleports while [restrained](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Restrained%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), that condition ends.
