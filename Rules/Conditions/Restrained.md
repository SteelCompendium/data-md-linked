##### Restrained

A creature who is [restrained](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/RestrainedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) has speed 0, can't use the Stand Up maneuver, and can't be force moved. A [restrained](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/RestrainedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) creature takes a bane on ability rolls and on Might and Agility tests, and abilities used against them gain an edge.

If a creature teleports while [restrained](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/RestrainedREL_PATH_SUFFIX), that condition ends.
