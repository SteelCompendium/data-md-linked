##### Taunted

A creature who is [taunted](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Taunted%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) has a double bane on ability rolls for any ability that doesn't target the creature who [taunted](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Taunted%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) them, as long as they have line of effect to that creature. If a creature gains the [taunted](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Taunted%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) condition from one source while already [taunted](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Taunted%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) by a different source, the new condition replaces the old one.
