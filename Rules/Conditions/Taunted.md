##### Taunted

A creature who is [taunted](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/TauntedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) has a double bane on ability rolls for any ability that doesn't target the creature who [taunted](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/TauntedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) them, as long as they have line of effect to that creature. If a creature gains the [taunted](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/TauntedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) condition from one source while already [taunted](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/TauntedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) by a different source, the new condition replaces the old one.
