##### Prone

While a creature is [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX), they are flat on the ground, any strike they make takes a bane, and melee abilities used against them gain an edge. A [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX) creature must [crawl](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/CrawlREL_PATH_SUFFIX) to move along the ground, which costs 1 additional square of movement for every square crawled. A creature can't [climb](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX), [jump](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/JumpREL_PATH_SUFFIX), [swim](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/Climb%20or%20SwimREL_PATH_SUFFIX), or [fly](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Movement/FlyREL_PATH_SUFFIX) while [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX). If they are climbing, flying, or jumping when knocked [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX), they fall.

Unless the ability or effect that imposed the [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX) condition says otherwise, a [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX) creature can stand up using the Stand Up maneuver (see [Maneuvers](#page-287-0) in [Chapter 10: Combat](#page-288-0)). A creature adjacent to a willing [prone](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/ProneREL_PATH_SUFFIX) creature can likewise use the Stand Up maneuver to make that creature stand up.
