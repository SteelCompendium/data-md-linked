##### Prone

While a creature is [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), they are flat on the ground, any strike they make takes a bane, and melee abilities used against them gain an edge. A [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) creature must [crawl](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Crawl%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) to move along the ground, which costs 1 additional square of movement for every square crawled. A creature can't \[climb\]({REL_PATH_PREFIX}Rules/Movement/Climb or Swim{REL_PATH_SUFFIX}), [jump](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Jump%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), \[swim\]({REL_PATH_PREFIX}Rules/Movement/Climb or Swim{REL_PATH_SUFFIX}), or [fly](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Movement/Fly%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) while [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D). If they are climbing, flying, or jumping when knocked [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), they fall.

Unless the ability or effect that imposed the [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) condition says otherwise, a [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) creature can stand up using the Stand Up maneuver (see [Maneuvers](#page-287-0) in [Chapter 10: Combat](#page-288-0)). A creature adjacent to a willing [prone](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Prone%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) creature can likewise use the Stand Up maneuver to make that creature stand up.
