##### Frightened

When a creature is [frightened](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Frightened%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D), any ability roll they make against the source of their fear takes a bane. If that source is a creature, their ability rolls made against the [frightened](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Frightened%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) creature gain an edge. A [frightened](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Frightened%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) creature can't willingly move closer to the source of their fear if they know the location of that source. If a creature gains the [frightened](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Frightened%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) condition from one source while already [frightened](%7BREL_PATH_PREFIX%7DRules/Conditions/Frightened%7BREL_PATH_SUFFIX%7D) by a different source, the new condition replaces the old one.
