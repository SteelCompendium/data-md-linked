##### Frightened

When a creature is [frightened](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/FrightenedREL_PATH_SUFFIX), any ability roll they make against the source of their fear takes a bane. If that source is a creature, their ability rolls made against the [frightened](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/FrightenedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) creature gain an edge. A [frightened](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/FrightenedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) creature can't willingly move closer to the source of their fear if they know the location of that source. If a creature gains the [frightened](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/FrightenedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) condition from one source while already [frightened](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/FrightenedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) by a different source, the new condition replaces the old one.
