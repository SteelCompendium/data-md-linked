##### Grabbed

A creature who is [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) has speed 0, can't be force moved except by a creature, object, or effect that has them [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX), can't use the Knockback maneuver (see [Maneuvers](#page-287-0) in [Chapter 10: Combat](#page-288-0)), and takes a bane on abilities that don't target the creature, object, or effect that has them [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX). If a creature is [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) by another creature and that creature moves, they bring the [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) creature with them. If a creature's size is equal to or less than the size of a creature they have [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX), their speed is halved while they have that creature [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX).

A creature who has another creature [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) can use a maneuver to move the [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) creature into an unoccupied space adjacent to them.

A creature can release a creature they have [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) at any time to end that condition (no action required). A [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) creature can attempt to escape being [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) using the Escape Grab maneuver (see [Chapter 10: Combat](#page-288-0)). If a [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) creature teleports, or if either the [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX) creature or the creature grabbing them is force moved so that both creatures are not adjacent to each other, that creature is no longer [grabbed](REL_PATH_PREFIXRules/Conditions/GrabbedREL_PATH_SUFFIX).

A creature can grab only creatures of their size or smaller. If a creature's Might score is 2 or higher, they can grab any creature larger than them with a size equal to or less than their Might score.

Unless otherwise indicated, a creature can grab only one creature at a time.
